A [Reactor](https://github.com/ash-project/reactor) extension that provides steps for working with the local filesytem.

## Example

The following example uses Reactor to reverse all the files in the specified directory.

```elixir
defmodule ReverseFilesInDirectory do
  use Reactor, extensions: [Reactor.File]

  input :directory

  file_glob :all_files do
    pattern input(:directory), transform: &Path.join(&1, "*")
  end

  map :reverse_files do
    source result(:all_files)

    file_read :read_file do
      path element(:reverse_files)
    end

    step :reverse_content do
      argument :content, result(:read_file)
      run &{:ok, &String.reverse(&1.content)}
    end

    file_write :write_file do
      path element(:reverse_files)
      contents result(:reverse_content)
    end

    return :write_file
  end

  return :reverese_files
end

Reactor.run!(ReverseFilesInDirectory, %{directory: "./to_reverse"})
```
